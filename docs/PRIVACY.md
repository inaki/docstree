## Overview

Docstree is a Chrome extension that displays your Google Drive files in a tree structure. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## What Data We Access

Docstree accesses the following from your Google Drive:
- File and folder names

## Data Sharing

We do NOT share, sell, rent, or transfer your data to any third parties. Period.
